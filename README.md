# MyCloud_RE

## Overview

MyCloud_RE is a reverse engineering project focused on open source files from WD Cloud Apps, including `mksapkg` for OS5 (and potentially OS3). The goal is to enable the creation and customization of applications for Western Digital (WD) NAS devices, especially since there is no comprehensive developer guide available.

## Motivation

Although the WD Community forum still exists, it lacks a clear and complete developer guide for creating new apps for WD NAS devices. This project aims to simplify the process by providing tools, documentation, and reverse-engineered resources to empower users and developers.

## Features

- Reverse engineering of `mksapkg` and related tools for WD NAS OS5 (and possibly OS3)
- Documentation and guides for building and packaging custom NAS applications
- Community-driven knowledge base for WD NAS app development

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Review the documentation and available scripts.
3. Contribute by sharing findings, scripts, or documentation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests to help improve the project.
